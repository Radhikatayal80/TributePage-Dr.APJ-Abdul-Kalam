            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, Indian scientist and honorable 11th president (2002-2007) of India,
                stepped into this world on October 15, 1931. He played a leading role in developing missile and nuclear
                weapon projects, which rewarded him with the nickname <i>The Missile Man</i>.</p>
            <p>He was a very simple person who lived an unpretentious lifestyle. He had a keen interest in literature
                and wrote poems. He never married. He always faced the media himself for his failures while letting others
                address for the successes. He remained active till the very end, passing away while delivering a lecture
                at IIM.</p>
